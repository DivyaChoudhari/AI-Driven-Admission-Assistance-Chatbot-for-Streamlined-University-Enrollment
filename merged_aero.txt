Research activities in Propulsion have been pursued at the Department since its inception in 1967. The Department is also the only one to offer a post graduate specialization in Propulsion amongst all similar departments in India.
The field of air-breathing propulsion involves various branches of science and engineering. However, only those involving aerodynamics, computational fluid dynamics, aerothermodynamics, structural analysis and materials technology are being pursued at the Department.
Past research studies have been funded mainly by the Propulsion Panel of the Aeronautics Research and Development Board, and have addressed problems related to gas turbine combustion, turbine heat transfer, blade vibration, rotor vibration, fuel control systems, engine sizing, transonic axial compressors, contra-rotating axial fans, tandem cascades, and turbine material lifing. Each of these studies has formed part of at least one funded research program, supported multiple post graduate students, and lead to publications in national as well as international conferences and journals.
Apart from the above problems in the field of air-breathing propulsion, some of the basic sciences underlying the propulsion field have been applied to the study of fluid flow and heat transfer in the callandria of a nuclear reactor, and in the development of a spirometer for biomedical applications.
Present research focuses on swept blades for axial compressors, hypersonic propulsion unit, compressor blade loss modeling, multistage transonic compressor performance prediction, transonic blade profile CFD analysis, gas turbine engine material lifing, CFD analysis of engine intakes, engine component analysis, infrared signature of aircraft engines, stall/surge prediction/indication, and hypersonic aircraft heat transfer. The links below give brief descriptions of some of this work.
Aerodynamic Heating in Aerospace Vehicles
As part of ongoing work, a computer code is being developed to predict the time -- temperature history of an entire hypersonic vehicle. Analysis of critical regions like sweptback leading edges has revealed significant differences in the behavior of aerodynamic heating. Part of the work focuses on the optimization of the insulating thermal protection system for a hypersonic vehicle.
Microchannel Cooling of Gas Turbine Blades
Basic investigations of behavior of fluid flow & heat transfer at micro scale revealed significant qualitative differences as compared to the macro scale. The effects that surface at the micro scale are being numerically identified. Some of these effects have fundamental repercussions in the understanding of the macro scale behavior as well. At present optimization of micro scale heat sink is in progress in the Department.
Aerothermal Flow Analysis of the Propulsion Unit of Hypersonic Aircraft
Ongoing work at the Department focuses on analysis leading to design of a propulsion unit for a hypersonic aircraft. The work involves analysis of various components and performance optimization over the given trajectory.
Modeling of losses in axial-flow compressors
As part of work funded by Pratt and Whitney, losses incurred in the rotors and stators of a multi-stage compressor were mathematically modeled. Separate modeling was required for two- and three-dimensional flows. The work resulted in a computer code for computing overall compressor performance based on these loss models.
A Novel Infrared Signature Suppression System for Helicopter Engines
Work done at the department has resulted in the conceptualization of an unconventional Infrared Signature Suppression System (IRSS) for helicopter engines. The new IRSS yields a maximum contrast of only 25 deg C with the local background from almost all the view angles of concern. In other words, the IRSS ensures that a helicopter engine operating at the most most critical point of the mission would appear hotter than the surroundings by not more than 25 deg C, making it extremely difficult for a heat-seeking missile to lock on to the helicopter. Without a signature suppressor, the temperature contrast between the engine and the surroundings would exceed 400 deg C. The temperature contrast achieved by the new IRSS is far superior to almost all the IRSS devices reported in open literature, which claim a minimum temperature contrast of 80 deg C. In addition, the reported IRSS devices have relatively significant back-pressure and weight penalties that effectively increase the IR Signature level of the helicopter since the engine has to operate at a higher combustion temperature to overcome the penalties without compromising the mission. In contrast, the IRSS conceptualized in the department has no back-pressure penalty, and an insignificant weight and drag penalty.Part of the work involved making a thermal model that simulates the multi-mode heat transfer including radiation interchange using analytical view factors for discretized geometry.
Some of the research work conducted using propulsion lab facility is outlined below:

This code is the first and only one of its kind developed in the country, and is comparable to the best in the field.
FRP Composite ComponentsThe Department pioneered work within the nation on development and application of composite structures technology to design and manufacture of products from aerospace as well as other engineering fields. Examples of such products and applications include fan blades, salinity gates, railway toilet, chemical containment, and replacements for certain metallic components of MiG 21 aircraft. Some of this work has been recognized by an award of excellence from the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India.
Mechanical characterization of Textile CompositesInvestigations have been carried out on thermo-mechanical and fracture behavior of textile composites. Further, low velocity impact and ballistic impact studies have been carried out on textile composites and laminated composites made of unidirectional layers. This work is part of a fundamental body of work of acknowledged stature in the area of material behavior of textile composites and has lead to over 40 publications in international journals in addition to three books.
Rehabilitation aids for the disabledA major experimental program within the Department studied the use of fiber reinforced composites and other lightweight materials in rehabilitation aids for the physically handicapped. The program included evaluation and redesign of the famed Jaipur foot, and led to the development of a carbon fiber composite Floor Reaction Polio Orthosis and modified-sole footwear for insensitive feet.

Diamond Jubilee Meet and Panel Discussion- 2nd February 2019




Aircraft, launch vehicles and satellites represent complicated aerospace systems comprising of many subsystems that exhibit a wide variety of complex nonlinear dynamical behavior. Examples of such complex behavior include the phenomena of surge and stall of compressors used in jet engines, wing rock oscillations and jump phenomena in combat aircraft, and structural vibrations in flexible space structures. These complex phenomena require equally complex control strategies to meet the stringent performance requirements on aerospace systems. The dynamical behavior of aerospace systems as well as the control strategies that it warrants present a challenge to the analysis and design of aerospace control systems.
Techniques based on bifurcation theory, nonlinear dynamical systems theory, linear and nonlinear control theory, stability theory, and neural and fuzzy control are being developed and applied to problems in aircraft flight dynamics and control, combustion acoustics, spacecraft attitude dynamics and control, and control of structural vibrations. The following links provide glimpses of recent and ongoing work at the Department in the area of Dynamics and Control.
Literal Approximations to Aircraft Dynamic Modes
The derivation of literal approximations to aircraft dynamic modes has engaged the attention of flight dynamicists for nearly a century since the work of Lanchester in the 1900"s. The topic is widely covered in all textbooks, yet it is universally accepted that the present approximations are often unsatisfactory. Attempts by several researchers to address this problem over the years have been largely unsuccessful. The problem has finally been resolved in recent work at IITB which shows that the existing approximations are faulty due to a crucial error in the derivations. A new formulation of the equations for flight stability has been derived and correct literal approximations obtained which are expected to replace the existing presentation in textbooks.




Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
Research and development in Computational Aerodynamics and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been an integral part of the overall activities of the department since the mid-seventies. Early work in this area was strongly coupled with the LCA program and resulted in panel-method-based codes for predicting aerodynamic loads on complete aircraft configurations. These codes have since given way to Euler and Navier Stokes codes for analyzing aerospace configurations of varying complexity. There has been a sustained effort in the area of Grid Generation over almost a decade resulting in IITZeus, a grid generation package capable of generating structured and unstructured multiblock grids for arbitrary three-dimensional configurations. The work mentioned above initially began through various research efforts, and culminated in tools that are used today by the aerospace-related community in the country.
Recent research and development work has focussed on the use of Finite Volume Time Domain (FVTD) techniques to numerically simulate electromagnetic scattering by aerospace configurations for calculating their Radar Cross Section (RCS), and the development of new CFD algorithms for applications such as computing the flow inside calandria of a nuclear reactor and simulating slosh in launch vehicles. Some recent and ongoing student projects include CFD in the hypersonic regime, simulating gas particle (dusty) flows and Cartesian-grid-based methods for arbitrary configurations.
Research in CFD is computationally intensive, and requires extensive computational support. CFD research at the department is supported by the Associate Center for CFD, which has several compute servers and workstations. A 16-noded Linux-based parallel cluster is a recent addition to the computational power in the CFD Center. Current parallel applications being investigated include RCS computations for aerospace configuration at the L, S and higher frequency bands.
A CFD software called IITZeus has been developed in the Department. IITZeus accepts CAD data from CAD systems and carries out CFD analysis including grid generation and post-processing using a variety of algorithms. The Department has developed potential and Euler codes for predicting aerodynamic loads over complete aircraft configurations. These codes have been and are being used for Indian aerospace programs.
Current work in Computational Electromagnetics (CEM) at the department involves numerical simulation of electromagnetic scattering from three-dimensional aerospace configurations for calculating the Radar Cross Section (RCS). The RCS is the area of a fictitious perfect reflector of electromagnetic waves that would reflect the same amount of energy back to the radar as the actual target, and is a measure of the target's visibility to the radar. The same object has different RCS at various viewing angles and radar frequencies. Reducing the RCS of aerospace configurations has become an important issue in combat applications. This work is being funded in part by ADA and HAL, Bangalore.
The Programme on Airship Design and Development (PADD) was launched at IIT Bombay in 2001, with team members drawn from various national aerospace organizations and private sector companies in India. PADD aims at developing airship technology in India for various scientific and commercial applications for various roles such as aerial surveillance, disaster management, and advertisement & product promotion. The first phase of PADD, a study project sponsored by Technology information Forecasting & Assessment Council (TIFAC), was completed in 2003. In this Phase, conceptual design studies of airships for transportation of goods and passengers over mountainous terrain under 'hot and high' conditions were carried out. Techno-economic feasibility of leasing airships for operation in India was investigated, and a Project Definition Report for development of two types of airship was proposed in future phases: the PADD Demo and the PADD PaxCargo.
Two remotely controlled airships, the PADD Micro (with a payload capacity of 1.0 kg) and PADD Mini (with a payload capacity of 3.5 kg) have been designed and developed. Studies are also being carried out in the areas of design and development of stratospheric airships; shape optimization of aerostat and airship envelopes; and development of robust control systems for unmanned airships.
Some of the work conducted at the Department has resulted in spin offs in the biomedical field. In the year 2002-2003, papers published by the faculty and students of the department appeared in AIAA Journal, Journal of Aircraft, Journal of Aeronautical Society of India, International Journal of Computers and Fluids, Journal of Royal Aeronautical Society, Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Journal of Reinforced plastics and Composites, Composite Structures, Journal of Composite Materials, Composites Science and Technology, Journal of Sound and Vibration, and Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics.
The Department also encourages faculty and students to participate in national and international conferences and professional meetings. Current funded research at the department addresses the specific areas of: Theoretical and computational flight dynamics, Nonlinear control laws for high-angle-of-attack flight, Dynamics and control of axial compressor stall/surge, Modeling and dynamics of fuel slosh, Aerodynamic estimation and trajectory simulation of cruciform missile configurations, RCS computation for aerospace bodies, Spacecraft attitude trajectory planning, Structural response reduction using active control, Aerothermal studies in hypersonic flows, Infrared signatures of combat aircraft engines, Mechanical performance of 3D woven composite structures, Design and analysis of propulsion unit for hypersonic vehicles, Design and analysis of transonic axial compressor blading, and Grid generation for CFD analysis.
